# AI Assistant Setup Guide

Welcome! This guide gives you an overview of how the AI assistant will help you set up the `gdrive-permissions` project.

The new assistant is a "state-aware" application. This means you can stop it at any time. When you restart it, it will automatically figure out where you left off and resume the setup process.

## The Setup Process

The assistant will guide you through the setup steps one by one. These steps are a mix of manual actions you'll perform in your web browser and automated actions the assistant will perform in the terminal.

### How it Works

1.  **State Detection:** Every time the assistant starts, it runs a series of checks to determine how much of the setup process you have already completed.
2.  **Guidance:** It then "jumps" to the first step that is not yet complete and begins guiding you from there.

### Your Role is Simple:

-   **Follow the Instructions:** Read the output from the assistant in the terminal.
-   **Perform Manual Steps:** When the assistant gives you instructions for a manual step (like creating a Google Sheet), it will provide a link to the `docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md` document. You will need to complete that step in your browser.
-   **Restart the Assistant:** After you complete a manual step, simply restart the assistant. It will detect your progress and move on to the next step.

There is no need for you to track phases or checklists. The assistant handles all the state management for you. Just follow its lead and restart it when it tells you to.
