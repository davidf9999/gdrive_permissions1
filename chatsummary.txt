Project summary (updated)
Objective
Grant non-owners edit access to specific Drive folders via Google Group membership, where group members are managed from a Google Sheet (no domain-wide delegation / impersonation).
Current auth/setup
GAM is configured with a Desktop OAuth client (oauth2.txt) and works for Directory/Admin ops.
Service-account key upload is blocked by org policy → we are deliberately not using DWD/impersonation right now.
This is compatible with our plan; impersonation is only needed if we must act as arbitrary users without sharing. (Apps Script advanced services + time-driven triggers cover our needs.) 
Google for Developers
Decisions
Manage group membership via GAM and/or Apps Script.
Share the target folder(s) directly to the Group (Editor role) via Drive UI. (Drive supports sharing folders to Google Groups.) 
Google Help
Use Apps Script time-driven triggers to keep membership in sync on a schedule; no deployment required for triggers or custom menus.

What works now
gam info domain and gam print users succeed (note: print users doesn’t take a limit flag).
Group editors@dfront1.com exists; you can bulk-add with gam csv ... add member ~Email (per GAM docs). 
GitHub
Sheet script syncGroupMembers() is in place, with: pagination of members, add/remove diffs, logging, summary alert, and a custom Group Tools menu.
Optional smoke test script verifies: Admin SDK reachable, Drive permissions listable, group is on the folder ACL, and the test user is in the group.
Open items / common blockers
If an external user (e.g., @gmail.com) can’t open the folder even after joining the group, check:
Folder actually shared to the Group (Editor). 
Google Help
External sharing policy allows sharing outside your domain. 
Google Help
Group settings permit external members. (Org & group-level settings.) 
Google for Developers
Wait for propagation and re-test in an incognito session under the correct account.
GAM Drive ACL commands that look like gam user <owner> add/show drivefileacl … will fail without a service account (they require impersonation). Use Drive UI to add the Group, or use Apps Script with the owner’s session. 
Google for Developers
Next steps (recommended)
In Drive, share each target folder with editors@dfront1.com as Editor. 
Google Help
Keep the improved syncGroupMembers() in the bound Sheet project; ensure Admin SDK is enabled as an Advanced Service. 
Google for Developers
Add/keep the custom menu (onOpen) and create a time-driven trigger (hourly/daily) via ScriptApp.newTrigger('syncGroupMembers')…. 
Google for Developers

Use the smoke test function to validate:
Members.list works and returns full pagination (Admin SDK). 
Google for Developers
Drive.Permissions.list returns group ACL on the folder (Advanced Drive). 
Google for Developers
(Optional later) If you need cross-user Drive actions without pre-sharing, revisit service account + Domain-Wide Delegation.
CLI workflows you can keep using
Create/sync groups via GAM CSV imports (per GAM wiki examples).
