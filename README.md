# Google Drive Permission Manager

> **Project Status: Beta**
>
> This project is currently in Beta. It is feature-complete and has been tested, but it is still under active development. Please use it with the understanding that there may be bugs or changes to the functionality. Feedback and contributions are welcome!

This repository contains a powerful solution for managing access to a large number of Google Drive folders using a central Google Sheet. It uses Google Groups to provide a scalable and auditable permissions system, all managed from a familiar spreadsheet interface.

The recommended setup is a simple, manual copy-and-paste of the core script, which can be done in minutes. An optional, more advanced setup is available for production environments that require higher API quotas.

## The Solution: Google Groups and Automation

This project solves the problem of managing Drive access at scale by using **Google Groups** as the access control mechanism. Instead of sharing a folder with many individual users (which can hit Google Drive's sharing limits), you share it with a single Google Group. This allows you to manage hundreds (or even thousands) of members by simply adding or removing them from that group.

This solution automates the entire lifecycle of this approach:

1.  You define which folders to manage in a central Google Sheet.
2.  The script automatically creates dedicated Google Groups for different roles (e.g., `project-x-editors@your-domain.com`).
3.  You manage the membership of these groups simply by adding or removing emails from other sheets.
4.  The script runs automatically to sync the group memberships, effectively granting or revoking access to the Drive folders.

## Setup Guide (Recommended Manual Setup)

This guide will walk you through the simple, one-time setup process. This is the recommended approach and requires no special tools.

### Step 1: Prerequisites

*   A **Google Workspace** account (a standard `@gmail.com` account is not sufficient).
*   You must be a **Super Admin** for your Google Workspace domain to have the necessary permissions to create Google Groups.

### Step 2: Create the Google Sheet

1.  Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com) and create a new, blank spreadsheet.
2.  Give it a descriptive name, for example: `Drive Permissions Control`.

### Step 3: Install the Apps Script

1.  In your new Google Sheet, click on **Extensions > Apps Script**. A new browser tab will open with the script editor.
2.  In the editor, click on `Code.gs` on the left, and delete the default `function myFunction() {}` code.
3.  Open the `apps_script_project/Code.js` file from this repository.
4.  Copy the entire contents of `Code.js` and paste it into the Apps Script editor.

### Step 4: Enable Required APIs (Detailed Guide)

This is the most technical step, but it's a one-time setup. We need to give our script permission to manage Google Groups. To do this, we'll enable a service in two places: first within Apps Script itself, and then in the underlying Google Cloud project.

**Important:** This part is only possible with a **Google Workspace** account (e.g., `you@yourcompany.com`). It will not work with a personal `@gmail.com` account. You also need to be a **Super Admin** of your Workspace.

---

#### **Part A: Enable the "Admin Directory API" in Apps Script**

This makes the service available to your script's code.

1.  **Find the "Services" section:** In the Apps Script editor, look at the left-hand navigation panel. You'll see "Editor" (with a `<>` icon), "Triggers" (with a clock icon), etc. A little further down, you'll see a section named **Services**.

2.  **Add a new service:** Click the **plus icon (+)** next to the "Services" title. A dialog box titled "Add a service" will appear.

3.  **Select the service:** Scroll through the list of available Google APIs until you find **Admin Directory API**. Click on it.

4.  **Confirm:** Click the blue **Add** button. The dialog will close, and you will now see `AdminDirectory` listed under the "Services" section.

---

#### **Part B: Enable the "Admin SDK API" in Google Cloud**

Every Apps Script project has a hidden Google Cloud project behind it. We need to turn on the API in that project.

1.  **Go to Project Settings:** In the Apps Script editor, click on the **Project Settings** icon (a gear ‚öôÔ∏è) in the left-hand navigation panel.

2.  **Find your Google Cloud Project:** In the settings page, scroll down to the "Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project" section. You will see a **Project Number** and a blue, clickable link that says **`View project in Google Cloud Console`**.

3.  **Open the Google Cloud Console:** Click that blue link. A new browser tab will open, taking you directly to the correct Google Cloud project dashboard. It might take a moment to load.

4.  **Navigate to the API Library:** In the Google Cloud Console, you'll see a search bar at the top of the page that says "Search products and resources". Click in this search bar.

5.  **Search for the API:** Type **`Admin SDK API`** into the search bar and press Enter.

6.  **Enable the API:** In the search results, click on "Admin SDK API". This will take you to the API's overview page. You will see a blue **Enable** button. Click it. If the button says "Manage" and is grayed out, it means the API is already enabled, and you don't need to do anything else.

---

### Step 5: Run the Initial Sync

1.  Save the script project by clicking the **Save project** (disk icon üíæ) at the top of the Apps Script editor.
2.  Go back to your Google Sheet tab and **refresh the page**.
3.  A new menu named **Permissions Manager** should appear in the Google Sheets menu bar.
4.  Click **Permissions Manager > Sync All**.
5.  The first time you run this, Google will ask you to authorize the script. Follow the on-screen prompts to grant the necessary permissions.

Your setup is now complete! The script will have automatically created the necessary control sheets (`ManagedFolders`, `Admins`, etc.) for you.

## Upgrading to a Production Environment

If you find that your script is running into API quota limits or timing out, you can upgrade to a dedicated, billable Google Cloud project for higher performance.

This hybrid approach allows you to start simple and scale up later without losing any of your work.

### Step 1: Provision the GCP Infrastructure

At any time, you can run the automated provisioning tool. This is an **advanced** procedure.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   **Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`):** [Installation Guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
    *   **Docker and Docker Compose:** [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
    *   An active **Google Cloud Billing Account**.
2.  **Configure:** Copy `setup.conf.example` to `setup.conf` and fill in your details (GCP Billing ID, domain, etc.).
3.  **Authenticate:** Run `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud auth application-default login` from your terminal.
4.  **Run:** Execute `docker compose up --build` from the project root.

This command will create a new, dedicated GCP project and output its **Project Number**. Copy this number.

### Step 2: Link Your Script to the New Project

1.  Open your existing Apps Script project.
2.  Click the **Project Settings** (gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è) on the left.
3.  Under the **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project** section, click **Change Project**.
4.  Paste the **Project Number** you copied from the provisioning step and click **Set Project**.

Your script is now linked to the high-performance GCP project. You don't need to change anything else.

## Tearing Down the Project

### Manual Setup

To remove the project, simply delete the Google Sheet you created. You may also want to manually delete the Google Groups that were created by the script from the [Google Workspace Admin Console](https://admin.google.com).

### Production Environment

If you used the automated provisioning tool, a `teardown.sh` script is provided to delete all the Google Cloud resources.

1.  Make sure the `gcp_project_id` in your `setup.conf` file points to the project you want to delete.
2.  Run the script from your terminal: `./teardown.sh`

---

## Advanced Features

This project also includes features for testing and logging, which are explained in more detail in [User Guide](./docs/USER_GUIDE.md) and [Testing](./docs/TESTING.md).

### Advanced Logging with Google Cloud

In addition to logging to a sheet, the script can be configured to send logs directly to **Google Cloud Logging (GCL)**. This provides a much more powerful, searchable, and persistent logging solution, which is highly recommended for production environments.

**Benefits:**
*   **Centralized Logging:** View logs from all script executions in one place.
*   **Advanced Filtering:** Search and filter logs by severity (INFO, WARN, ERROR), time, or keyword.
*   **Log-based Metrics & Alerts:** Create alerts for specific errors (e.g., notify you when a "FATAL ERROR" occurs).
*   **Long-term Retention:** Store logs for extended periods, beyond the limits of a Google Sheet.

**How to Enable:**

1.  **Link to a GCP Project:** First, your Apps Script project **must** be linked to a standard Google Cloud Project. Follow the steps in the [Upgrading to a Production Environment](#upgrading-to-a-production-environment) section to do this.
2.  **Enable in the Sheet:** In your Google Sheet, go to the `Config` sheet and change the value for `EnableGCPLogging` from `FALSE` to `TRUE`.

Once enabled, all logs will be sent to Google Cloud Logging. You can view them by navigating to the [Logs Explorer](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/viewer) in the Google Cloud Console for your linked project.

## Admin Directory Prerequisites

Some features (Google Group creation, membership sync, and permission assignment via groups) require the **Admin Directory** advanced service in Apps Script and the **Admin SDK** API in Google Cloud.

- Apps Script: Add the service via the Services panel (Admin Directory API).
- Google Cloud: Enable the Admin SDK in the linked GCP project.
- Access: Requires Google Workspace. Personal `@gmail.com` accounts cannot use the Admin SDK.

Behavior without Admin SDK:
- The script runs, creates/updates sheets and folders, and logs progress.
- Group operations are skipped and clearly marked as `SKIPPED (No Admin SDK)` in the `Status` columns.
- Tests that require groups will alert and abort.

---

## First Run & Testing Notes

- Manual Access Test and Stress Test require Admin SDK. If not enabled or if you‚Äôre on a personal Gmail account, they will show an alert and abort.
- If you want to validate sheet/folder setup only (without Admin SDK), run `Permissions Manager > Sync All` and verify:
  - `ManagedFolders` rows populate `FolderID`, `UserSheetName`, and `GroupEmail`.
  - `Status` shows `SKIPPED (No Admin SDK)` when group ops are not available.
- To fully exercise group membership and permissions, ensure Admin SDK is enabled and your account has the required admin privileges.
