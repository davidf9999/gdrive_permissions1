## How to Stop a Running Script

Google Apps Script does not have a built-in "force stop" button directly in the spreadsheet UI. However, you can manually stop any running script execution from the Apps Script dashboard.

Here are the steps:

1.  **Open the Apps Script Editor:** From your spreadsheet, go to **Extensions > Apps Script**.
2.  **Navigate to Executions:** On the left-hand sidebar, click on the **Executions** tab (it looks like a play button with a list).
3.  **Find and Stop the Script:** You will see a list of all recent and currently running script executions. Find the one with the status **"Running"** that you want to stop.
4.  **Click the three dots (â‹®)** on the right side of the running execution and select **"Terminate"**.

This will immediately stop the script. This is useful if a test or sync process is taking too long or you have started it by mistake.
