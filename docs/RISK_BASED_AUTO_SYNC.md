# Risk-Based Auto-Sync Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the risk levels of different permission management operations and defines a strategy for safe automated synchronization in the Google Drive Permission Manager.

### The Core Problem

**Background triggers cannot display UI dialogs for user confirmation**, causing operations that require user interaction to fail silently when run automatically. Additionally, different operations have vastly different risk profiles when executed incorrectly:

- **Adding permissions incorrectly**: Low risk (over-permissioning, easily noticed and fixed)
- **Removing permissions incorrectly**: High risk (blocks legitimate users, causes business disruption)

### Key Issues Identified

1. **`syncAdmins()`** (Sync.gs:64-71) requires confirmation before adding/removing spreadsheet editors
2. **`syncDeletes()`** (Sync.gs:315-324) requires confirmation before removing users from groups
3. **`fullSync()`** (currently called by `autoSync()`) internally calls `syncDeletes()`, which fails in background execution
4. All operations are currently treated equally, regardless of their risk profile

## Risk Level Framework

### Simplified Risk Model

The system uses **three risk levels** based on consequence of error and reversibility:

| Risk Level | Operations | Impact if Wrong | Auto-Sync Treatment | Admin Action |
|:-----------|:-----------|:----------------|:--------------------|:-------------|
| **SAFE**<br>*(Additive)* | ‚Ä¢ Add users to groups<br>‚Ä¢ Create folders & share with groups<br>‚Ä¢ Add spreadsheet editors<br>‚Ä¢ Create Google Groups<br>‚Ä¢ All `syncAdds()` operations including admins | Users get unintended access (easily reverted and detected) | ‚úÖ **Automatic**<br>Runs hourly with post-notification email | Review summary email; revert if needed |
| **DESTRUCTIVE**<br>*(Reversible Removals)* | ‚Ä¢ Remove users from groups<br>‚Ä¢ Remove spreadsheet editors<br>‚Ä¢ Revoke folder permissions<br>‚Ä¢ All `syncDeletes()` operations | Users lose access they need, work blocked, requires restoration | üõë **Manual Only**<br>Notifies admin, does NOT execute | Run "Sync Deletes" manually after review |
| **CRITICAL**<br>*(Irreversible)* | ‚Ä¢ `mergeSync()` - Approve manual changes<br>‚Ä¢ Delete Google Groups (permanent)<br>‚Ä¢ Delete Drive folders (data loss)<br>‚Ä¢ Domain-wide bulk changes | Permanent data loss or inadvertent approval of unauthorized access | üö´ **Always Manual**<br>Never automated, requires human judgment | Run manually with full context |

### Why This Model is Safe

**Key Design Principle**: The distinction between SAFE and DESTRUCTIVE is based on **user impact**, not privilege level.

**Why Admin Additions are SAFE**:
- Adding wrong admin = Reversible (remove from Admins sheet, sync again)
- Detected quickly (admin email notification immediately after)
- Low blast radius (one person, not mass-change)
- Same recovery path as any wrong permission grant

**Why Deletions are DESTRUCTIVE**:
- Removing legitimate user = Immediate work stoppage
- Hard to detect (user discovers when they try to access)
- High blast radius (affects user productivity immediately)
- Complex recovery (identify who needs access, restore, notify)

### Risk Classification Rationale

**Why is deletion more risky than addition?**

| Scenario | Adding Permissions (Wrong) | Deleting Permissions (Wrong) |
|:---------|:---------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| **User Impact** | User has access they shouldn't (may not even notice) | User loses access they need (immediate work stoppage) |
| **Detection Time** | May go unnoticed for long periods | Detected immediately when user tries to access |
| **Business Impact** | Security risk (contained, no data loss) | Productivity loss, missed deadlines, potential data loss |
| **Reversibility** | Easy to remove excess permissions | May be hard to identify who should have access |
| **User Perception** | Rarely noticed by affected user | User frustration, support tickets, escalations |
| **Remediation** | Simple: remove the incorrect permission | Complex: determine correct permissions, notify user, restore access |

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Fix Current Auto-Sync Failure

**Current Issue**: `autoSync()` ‚Üí `fullSync()` ‚Üí `syncDeletes()` ‚Üí fails on UI confirmation dialog

**Solution**: Modify `autoSync()` to only call risk-appropriate operations based on configuration.

**Default Behavior**:
- Auto-sync runs **SAFE operations only** (all additions including admins)
- Detects pending DESTRUCTIVE/CRITICAL operations
- Sends email notifications for operations requiring manual execution

### Phase 2: Configuration Settings

Add these settings to the **Config sheet**:

| Setting Name | Default Value | Description |
|:-------------|:--------------|:------------|
| `EnableAutoSync` | `TRUE` | Master switch: enable/disable automatic synchronization |
| `NotifyAfterSync` | `TRUE` | Send email summary after each auto-sync completion |
| `NotifyDeletionsPending` | `TRUE` | Send email when deletions detected (require manual action) |
| `AutoSyncMaxDeletions` | `10` | Safety limit: if deletions exceed this, notify admin but don't allow manual sync without review |

**No Complex Modes**: Behavior is simple and predictable:
- ‚úÖ Auto-sync always runs **SAFE** operations (all additions)
- üõë **DESTRUCTIVE** operations always require manual execution
- üö´ **CRITICAL** operations always require manual execution with full context

### Phase 3: Auto-Sync Behavior

**Single, Simple Behavior**:
1. **Automatic**: All SAFE operations (additive) run on schedule
2. **Detect & Notify**: Check for pending DESTRUCTIVE operations, email admin
3. **Never Execute**: DESTRUCTIVE and CRITICAL operations never run automatically

**Implementation**:
```
autoSync() executes:
  ‚Üí syncAdds() including admin additions (SAFE)
  ‚Üí checkPendingDeletions() and notify if found (DESTRUCTIVE)
  ‚Üí sendSummaryEmail() with results
```

No modes, no configuration complexity, predictable behavior.

### Phase 4: Notification System

**Two Simple Email Types**:

#### A. Summary Email (After Every Auto-Sync)

Sent after each successful auto-sync:
- **Subject**: "‚úÖ Auto-Sync Completed"
- **Content**:
  - Users added (including any new admins)
  - Folders shared
  - Groups created
  - Errors/warnings
  - **Pending deletions requiring manual action**

#### B. Action Required Email (When Deletions Pending)

Sent when DESTRUCTIVE operations detected:
- **Subject**: "‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Action Required: Permission Deletions Pending"
- **Content**: Summary of pending deletions with step-by-step instructions
- **Action**: Admin must run "Sync Deletes" manually

**That's it.** No pre-execution emails, no cancellation mechanisms, no complexity.

---

## User/Admin Workflows

### Workflow for Volunteers (Non-Admin Users)

1. **Add users**: Edit permission sheets, add email addresses to group sheets
   - **Result**: Auto-sync grants access within 1 hour (no admin action needed)

2. **Remove users**: Delete email addresses from group sheets
   - **Result**: Auto-sync detects change, notifies admin (admin must approve deletion)

3. **Check status**: View "Status" column in sheets
   - `OK` = Synced successfully
   - `Pending deletion - admin approval needed` = Waiting for admin

### Workflow for Admins

| Scenario | What Happens Automatically | Admin Action Required |
|:---------|:---------------------------|:---------------------|
| **Users added to sheets** | Auto-sync grants access within 1 hour | ‚úÖ None (review summary email periodically) |
| **Users removed from sheets** | Auto-sync detects, sends "Action Required" email | ‚ö†Ô∏è Check email ‚Üí Run "Sync Deletes" manually ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Confirm |
| **Admin list changed in Admins sheet** | Auto-sync detects, sends "Action Required" email | ‚ö†Ô∏è Check email ‚Üí Run "Sync Admins" manually ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Confirm |
| **Manual changes in Google Groups** | Auto-sync continues normal operations | ‚ö†Ô∏è Run "Merge & Reconcile" to document manual changes |
| **Auto-sync error occurs** | Error email sent with details | ‚ö†Ô∏è Check logs, fix issue, optionally run manual sync |
| **Edit Mode enabled** | Auto-sync suspended (skips all operations) | ‚úÖ None (resume when Edit Mode disabled) |

### Admin Email Examples

#### Example 1: Summary Email (Routine)
```
Subject: ‚úÖ Auto-Sync Completed Successfully

Summary:
- 5 users added to groups
- 2 new folders shared
- 0 errors

No manual actions required at this time.

Last sync: 2025-10-21 14:00:00
Next sync: 2025-10-21 15:00:00
```

#### Example 2: Action Required Email (Deletions Pending)
```
Subject: ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Action Required: 3 Permission Deletions Pending

Auto-sync detected users removed from permission sheets.
The following deletions require manual approval:

From Group 'ProjectX-Editors':
  - john.doe@example.com
  - jane.smith@example.com

From Group 'ProjectY-Viewers':
  - bob.jones@example.com

To execute these deletions:
1. Open the control spreadsheet
2. Go to: Permissions Manager ‚Üí Sync Deletes
3. Review the deletion list carefully
4. Confirm to proceed

Note: Deletions will NOT execute automatically.
```

## Safety Features

### Built-In Safeguards

1. **Fail-Safe Defaults**
   - Auto-sync only performs low-risk additive operations by default
   - Destructive operations always require explicit manual execution

2. **Email Notifications**
   - Admin receives summary of all auto-sync actions
   - Proactive alerts for pending manual actions
   - Error notifications for failures

3. **Audit Trail**
   - All operations logged with timestamps, risk levels, and outcomes
   - Deletion operations logged separately for potential rollback

4. **Manual Override**
   - Edit Mode disables all auto-sync (for bulk editing)
   - Admin can disable auto-sync via Config sheet

5. **Deletion Limits**
   - Configurable threshold (default: 10 deletions)
   - Auto-abort if deletions exceed limit (prevents mass-removal mistakes)
   - Admin must review and increase limit or run deletions in batches

6. **Lock Mechanism**
   - Prevents concurrent syncs that could cause race conditions
   - Auto-sync skips execution if another sync is running

7. **Edit Mode Detection**
   - Auto-sync automatically skips when spreadsheet is in Edit Mode
   - Prevents conflicts during bulk administrative changes

### Risk Mitigation Matrix

| Risk | Without Auto-Sync | With Simplified Auto-Sync | Mitigation |
|:-----|:------------------|:--------------------------|:-----------|
| **Accidental deletion of legitimate user** | Admin must remember to run sync | Admin must explicitly approve deletions | DESTRUCTIVE: Email notification + manual approval |
| **Wrong admin added to control sheet** | Admin must remember to run sync | Automatic execution with notification | SAFE: Post-notification + easy reversal |
| **Mass deletion due to sheet corruption** | Admin would catch during manual review | Safety limit prevents execution | `AutoSyncMaxDeletions` threshold blocks sync |
| **Auto-sync runs during bulk editing** | N/A | Edit Mode suspends auto-sync | Edit Mode detection |
| **Forgetting to grant access to new users** | Users must request access | Auto-sync grants within 1 hour | SAFE: Automatic execution |

## Migration Path

### For Existing Deployments

**Current State**: Auto-sync calls `fullSync()` which includes deletions (fails silently)

**Migration Steps**:
1. Update `autoSync()` function to call `syncAdds()` instead of `fullSync()`
2. Add new Config sheet settings with safe defaults
3. Add notification helper functions for pending deletions
4. Update admin documentation

**Backward Compatibility**:
- New behavior is safer than current implementation
- Existing manual sync menu items unchanged
- No changes to sheet structure or user workflows
- Admin can disable auto-sync if desired (`EnableAutoSync: FALSE`)

### Recommended Default Configuration

For new deployments, use these settings:

```
Config Sheet Settings:
- EnableAutoSync: TRUE
- NotifyAfterSync: TRUE
- NotifyDeletionsPending: TRUE
- AutoSyncMaxDeletions: 10
```

This simple configuration provides:
- ‚úÖ Automatic permission grants including admins (low friction)
- ‚úÖ Manual approval required for all deletions (high safety)
- ‚úÖ Admin visibility of all changes (summary emails)
- ‚úÖ Protection against mass-deletion mistakes (safety threshold)

## Conclusion

By classifying operations by **consequence of error** rather than just technical complexity, we can safely automate low-risk additive operations while requiring explicit manual approval for high-risk destructive operations. This approach:

1. **Reduces admin burden**: Routine permission grants happen automatically
2. **Maintains safety**: Deletions always require manual review and confirmation
3. **Increases visibility**: Admins receive clear notifications of pending actions
4. **Prevents silent failures**: Background triggers never attempt to show UI dialogs
5. **Provides flexibility**: Configurable risk levels for different organizational needs

**Key Principle**: *Fail open on additions (users complain and you fix), fail safe on deletions (prevent users from losing access).*

This simplified three-level model strikes the optimal balance between automation convenience and operational safety, while being easy to understand and implement.
