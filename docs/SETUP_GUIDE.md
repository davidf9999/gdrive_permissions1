# Google Drive Permission Manager Setup

Welcome to the Google Drive Permission Manager setup process. This page will direct you to the correct guide based on your role.

## For Super Admins: Initial Setup

If you are a **Google Workspace Super Admin** and are setting up this system for the very first time, you need to follow the detailed, step-by-step setup guide. This guide covers everything from creating a Google Workspace tenant to deploying the script and running the first sync.

**➡️ See the [Super Admin Setup Guide](SUPER_ADMIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md) to get started.**

Once setup is complete, you can refer to the [Super Admin User Guide](SUPER_ADMIN_USER_GUIDE.md) for ongoing daily tasks.

## For Sheet Editors: Daily Usage

If the system is already set up and you have been designated as a **Sheet Editor**, your role is to manage permissions by editing the control spreadsheet. You do not need to perform the initial setup.

**➡️ See the [Sheet Editor User Guide](SHEET_EDITOR_USER_GUIDE.md) to learn how to manage permissions.**
