## Understanding Roles

Before starting the setup, it's important to understand the different roles involved. You will primarily act as the **Installer**, using a **Google Workspace Super Admin** account to perform the privileged actions. We have created a dedicated guide for this.

**➡️ See [Roles and Responsibilities](ROLES_AND_RESPONSIBILITIES.md) for a full breakdown.**

## Optional onboarding aids

- **Screen recording walkthrough:** Record a short (5–10 minute) video that
  demonstrates the exact clicks in this guide. Tools like Loom, Screencastify,
  or Google Meet recordings are sufficient—you do not need professional editing
  to be helpful.
- **Slide deck or checklist PDF:** Export this guide or the
  [`ONBOARDING.md`](ONBOARDING.md) checklist to share with colleagues who
  prefer printable references.
- **Live demo session:** Host a short call where you follow this guide in real
  time and let other admins ask questions.

Any of these aids can significantly reduce onboarding time for new team members
once you have the written steps in place.
