# Google Drive Permissions Manager: User Guide

Welcome! This guide helps you find the correct instructions for using the Google Drive Permissions Manager based on your role.

This system has two primary types of users:

1.  **Super Admins:** Google Workspace administrators who are responsible for the initial setup, running the synchronization scripts, and performing advanced maintenance.

2.  **Sheet Editors:** Team members who are responsible for the day-to-day management of permissions. They control who gets access to what by adding and removing users from the various control sheets within this spreadsheet.

A single person can be both a Super Admin and a Sheet Editor.

**Important:** A Google Workspace Super Admin is **not** automatically a Sheet Editor. To run the administrative scripts, a Super Admin must also be explicitly granted "Editor" access to this Google Sheet, just like any other Sheet Editor.
