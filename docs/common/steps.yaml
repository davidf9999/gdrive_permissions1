      ## 1. Create or reuse a Google Workspace tenant

      1. Go to [workspace.google.com](https://workspace.google.com/) to start a free trial or sign in.
      2. When prompted, provide a domain you own or purchase one through Google Domains (the default option during setup).
      3. Complete the sign-up form to create the administrator account.
      4. Verify domain ownership via a DNS record. Follow the official [domain verification steps](https://support.google.com/a/answer/183895).
      5. (Optional) Run DNS sanity checks to confirm delegation and verification records:
         ```bash
         ./scripts/dns_sanity_check.sh your-domain.com [subdomain]
         ```
         * After setup, expect TXT/MX records to appear.
         * After teardown, SOA/NS should still exist; empty A/AAAA/MX/TXT answers (NOERROR with SOA) are expected.

      ## 5. Configure the Google Cloud CLI (gcloud)

      > **Note for AI Assistant Users:** The assistant should ask you to run these commands in your own terminal. It should not try to authenticate `gcloud` for you.

      This step gives `gcloud` permission to manage resources in your Google Cloud project.

      1.  **Verify `gcloud` installation.** In your terminal, run `gcloud --version`. If the command is not found, try opening a new terminal first. If it still fails, please create an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/davidf9999/gdrive_permissions1/issues).
      2.  **Authenticate `gcloud`.** Run `gcloud auth login` and follow the link to sign in with your **Google Workspace Super Admin** account.
      3.  **Set your GCP Project.** Run `gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID`, replacing `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with the ID you saved from Step 3.

      ### Step 5: Configure the Google Cloud CLI (gcloud)
      *** Current state: 5 "Configure the Google Cloud CLI (gcloud)" out of 8 steps. ***
      You need to authenticate the `gcloud` CLI tool so it can manage resources in your GCP project. For authentication, you should run the commands in your own terminal.

      **Manual Action Required:**
      Please run these commands in your terminal, then let me know once each one completes:
      1. `gcloud --version`
      2. `gcloud auth login`

      ## 7. Deploy the Apps Script project

      1.  **Install dependencies (optional).** If you want to build the bundle locally, run `npm install`.
      2.  **Build the script bundle (optional).** This command combines all source files into a single file for deployment.
          ```bash
          npm run build
          ```
          If you prefer not to run build commands locally, use the prebuilt bundle committed in `dist/apps_scripts_bundle.gs`.
      3.  **Copy the bundled code.** Open `dist/apps_scripts_bundle.gs`, select all text, and copy it.
      4.  **Paste into the Apps Script Editor.** Return to the Apps Script editor, delete any code in `Code.gs`, paste the bundled code, and save.
      5.  **Configure Project Settings.**
          *   In the Apps Script editor, open **Project Settings** (⚙️).
          *   Check the box for **Show "appsscript.json" manifest file in editor**.
          *   Return to the editor and open the new `appsscript.json` file.
          *   Copy the content from `apps_script_project/appsscript.json` in this repository and paste it into the editor's `appsscript.json`.
          *   In the editor, set the `timeZone` to your organization's timezone (e.g., `America/New_York`). Save the file.
      6.  **Link the GCP Project.** In **Project Settings** (⚙️), scroll to **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project**, click **Change project**, and enter your GCP **Project Number**.
          *   Find the Project Number in the Cloud Console under **Project info**.
          *   Or run `gcloud projects describe YOUR_PROJECT_ID --format='value(projectNumber)'` in your terminal.
          *   **Do not** try to infer the Project Number from the Project ID.
      7.  Return to your spreadsheet and **refresh the page**. The **Permissions Manager** menu should appear.

      > **Note on Configuration:** The script's configuration (like Sheet ID) is stored in a sheet named `Config`, which will be created automatically on the first run.

      ### Step 7: Deploy the Apps Script project
      *** Current state: 7 "Deploy the Apps Script project" out of 8 steps. ***
      Now it's time to deploy the actual script code into the Apps Script project you created earlier. This involves building the project locally and then copying the code manually.

      **Automated Action (with your approval):**
      I can run `npm install` and `npm run build` to prepare the script bundle for deployment.

      **Manual Action Required:**
      You will then need to manually copy the bundled code into your Apps Script editor, configure the `appsscript.json` manifest, and link your GCP project in the Apps Script project settings.

      **To find your Project Number:**
      * In the Cloud Console, open **Project info** and copy the **Project number**.
      * Or run `gcloud projects describe YOUR_PROJECT_ID --format='value(projectNumber)'` in your terminal.
      * **Do not** try to infer the Project Number from the Project ID.

      **Do you want me to proceed with building the Apps Script project? (yes/no)**
