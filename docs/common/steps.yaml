      ## 1. Create or reuse a Google Workspace tenant

      1. Visit [workspace.google.com](https://workspace.google.com/) and start a free
         trial or sign in if your organisation already has a tenant.
      2. When prompted for a domain, either:
         - Enter the domain you already own and plan to use for email, **or**
         - Purchase a new domain through Google during the sign-up flow.
      3. Complete the sign-up form to create the initial administrator account. Keep
         the username and password handy—you will use this account for the rest of the
         setup.
      4. Verify the domain ownership when prompted (usually by adding a TXT record to
         your DNS provider). Follow the official
         [domain verification steps](https://support.google.com/a/answer/183895) and
         use a record similar to:

         | Type | Name/Host | Value |
         | ---- | --------- | ----- |
         | TXT  | @         | google-site-verification=abc123example |

      </details>

      > **Tip:** If your organisation already has Workspace, sign into the Admin
      > console with an existing Super Admin instead of creating a brand new tenant.

      **Common issues at this step:**
      - ❌ Domain verification fails → Double-check that the TXT record value matches
        exactly and allow DNS propagation (can take up to an hour).
      - ❌ Wrong domain appears in Admin Console → Confirm you started signup with the
        domain you intend to manage.

    setup_guide: |
      ## 2. Prepare the Super Admin account

      1. Sign in to [admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com/) using the admin
         account from the previous step.
      2. Confirm the account has the **Super Admin** role by visiting
         **Directory → Users → [your user] → Admin roles and privileges**. If the role
         is missing, assign it now.

      </details>

      3. Enable the Google Groups service if it is not already active:
         - Navigate to **Apps → Google Workspace → Groups for Business**.
         - Click **On for everyone** and save.
      4. **Crucial:** Enable 2-Step Verification (2SV) for the admin account in
         **Security → 2-step verification**. Google Cloud enforces this, and you will be blocked from proceeding without it.
      5. Open a new tab to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)
         and accept the Terms of Service so the account can manage Google Cloud
         resources.

      > **Why Super Admin?** Admin SDK calls that create and manage Google Groups
      > require Super Admin privileges. Delegated roles typically cannot grant the
      > scopes needed for the script to function, so perform setup with a Super
      > Admin account.

      **Common issues at this step:**
      - ❌ Groups for Business not available → Ensure the service is enabled for the
        entire organisation, not just an OU subset.
      - ❌ Cannot access Cloud Console → Accept the Terms of Service while signed in
        with the Super Admin account and retry.

      -   **ACTION:**
          1.  Check if your internal `superAdminEmail` variable is already set (from loading the state file).
          2.  If it is, ask the installer: "I have your Super Admin email as `<superAdminEmail>`. Is this correct? (yes/no)".
              -   If they say "yes", proceed to VERIFICATION.
              -   If they say "no", ask them: "Please enter the correct Google Workspace Super Admin email address."
          3.  If `superAdminEmail` is not set, ask the installer: "Please enter your Google Workspace Super Admin email address."
          4.  Once you receive the email address, store it in your `superAdminEmail` context variable.
          5.  Use `write_file` to save the email to `.gemini/assistant_state.json`. The content should be a JSON object: `{"SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL": "<the_email>"}`.

      ## 3. Create the control spreadsheet

      This step must be performed while signed in as the **Google Workspace Super Admin**.

      1. While signed in as the Super Admin, go to Google Drive and create a new
         Google Spreadsheet. Give it a descriptive name such as `Drive Permissions Control`.
      2. Inside the spreadsheet, open **Extensions → Apps Script** to create a bound Apps
         Script project. Leave the editor open—you will connect the local source files
         shortly.
      3. In the Apps Script editor, open **Project Settings → IDs** and take note of the **Script ID** value.

          2.  **Authenticate the CLI (Manual):**
              -   Explain this part is manual.
              -   Provide these instructions:
                  1. In your terminal, run the command: `gcloud auth login`
                  2. Your browser will open. You **must** sign in as the Google Workspace Super Admin (**`<superAdminEmail>`**).
              -   Ask the installer to confirm once they have logged in.
          3.  **Set GCP Project (Automated):** Ask for their GCP Project ID and run `gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>`.
      -   **VERIFICATION:**
          1.  Run `gcloud auth list` and `gcloud config get-value project`.

    setup_guide: |
      ## 4. Authenticate the Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`)

      > **Note for AI Assistant Users:** The assistant will now handle these command-line steps for you.

      This step gives `gcloud` permission to manage resources in your Google Cloud project, like enabling APIs.

      1.  **Verify `gcloud` installation.** In your terminal, run `gcloud --version`. If the command is not found, you must install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) first. In the recommended Codespaces environment, it should be pre-installed.

      2.  **Authenticate `gcloud`.**
          *   In your terminal, run the following command:
              ```bash
              gcloud auth login
              ```
          *   Follow the link to your browser. When prompted, sign in using the **same Google Workspace Super Admin** account you prepared in Step 2.
          *   Return to the terminal after you have successfully logged in.

      3.  **Set your GCP Project.** Tell `gcloud` which project you are working on. Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual Google Cloud Project ID.
          ```bash
          gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
          ```

      **Common issues at this step:**
      - ❌ `gcloud: command not found` → Ensure the tool is installed and its location is in your system's PATH.
      - ❌ `Access blocked` during login → Verify that 2-Step Verification is enabled on your Google Workspace Super Admin account.

          3.  Instruct them to get ready to follow the parts of **Step 5: Enable APIs and grant consent** that require manual browser interaction.
      -   **Sub-steps:**
          1.  **Enable Project-Level APIs (Automated):**
              - Explain you will now enable the required APIs for their GCP project.
              - Run the `gcloud services enable` commands for `admin.googleapis.com`, `drive.googleapis.com`, and `script.googleapis.com`.
          2.  **Enable User-Level API (Manual):**
              - Instruct them to visit `script.google.com/home/usersettings` and enable the "Google Apps Script API".
          3.  **Configure OAuth Consent Screen (Manual):**
              - Instruct them to follow the guide to configure the OAuth consent screen if they haven't already.
      -   **VERIFICATION:**
          1.  When the installer confirms completion, transition to `SCRIPT_DEPLOYED`.
    setup_guide: |
      ## 5. Enable APIs and grant consent

      The script requires several Google Cloud APIs to be enabled for your GCP project, and the Apps Script API must be enabled for the Super Admin's user account.

      1.  **Enable the Project-Level APIs.** In your terminal, run the following `gcloud` commands to enable the required APIs for your project:
          ```bash
          # Enable Admin SDK API (for Google Groups management)
          gcloud services enable admin.googleapis.com --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID

          # Enable Drive API (for folder permissions)
          gcloud services enable drive.googleapis.com --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID

          # Enable Apps Script API (for script management)
          gcloud services enable script.googleapis.com --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
          ```
          Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with your actual GCP project ID.

      2.  **Enable the User-Level API.** This is a manual step.
          -   Visit **[script.google.com/home/usersettings](https://script.google.com/home/usersettings)**.
          -   Find the setting for "Google Apps Script API" and toggle it **ON**.

          > **Note:** After enabling these APIs, wait 2-5 minutes for the changes to propagate through Google's systems before proceeding.

      3.  **Configure the OAuth Consent Screen.** If you have not done so already for this project:
          -   In the [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com), navigate to **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**.
          -   User type: **Internal** (recommended for most Workspace tenants).
          -   App name: something descriptive such as `Drive Permission Manager`.
          -   Add the Super Admin account as a test user, then save and publish.

      **Common issues at this step:**
      - ❌ API errors during a later step → Verify you enabled all three APIs in the Cloud Console (`gcloud` commands) **and** the Apps Script user settings page.
      - ❌ `"The Admin SDK API is not enabled for GCP project..."` error when running tests → Run `gcloud services enable admin.googleapis.com --project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID` and wait 2-5 minutes.
      - ❌ APIs not propagating → Wait a full 5 minutes after enabling before testing.

          1.  When the installer confirms, transition to `FIRST_SYNC_COMPLETE`.
    setup_guide: |
      ## 6. Deploy the Apps Script project

      Now you will deploy the code from this repository into the Apps Script project you created. This is a manual copy-and-paste process.

      1.  **Install project dependencies.** In your local terminal, at the root of the repository, run `npm install`. This is only needed once.
          ```bash
          npm install
          ```
      2.  **Build the script bundle.** Run the build script to combine all the separate source code files into a single bundle for deployment.
          ```bash
          node create_apps_scripts_bundle.js
          ```
          This will create a new file at `dist/apps_scripts_bundle.gs`.

      3.  **Copy the bundled code.** Open the `dist/apps_scripts_bundle.gs` file in a text editor, select all the text, and copy it to your clipboard.

      4.  **Paste into the Apps Script Editor.**
          *   Return to the Apps Script editor you opened in Step 3.
          *   If there is any existing code in the `Code.gs` file, delete it completely.
          *   Paste the code from your clipboard into the `Code.gs` editor window.
          *   Click the **Save project** icon (a floppy disk) at the top of the editor.

      5.  **Configure Project Settings.**
          *   In the Apps Script editor, open **Project Settings** (gear icon in the left sidebar).
          *   Scroll to **General settings** and set the timezone to your preferred timezone (e.g., `America/New_York`, `Europe/London`, `Etc/UTC`). The default timezone in the repository is UTC, but you should change it to match your organization's timezone.
          *   Scroll to **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project** and enter your GCP Project ID (you can find this in the Google Cloud Console).

      6.  **Create the config.json file.**
          *   In the Apps Script editor, click the **+** button next to **Files** in the left sidebar.
          *   Select **Script** and name it `config.json`.
          *   Open the `apps_script_project/config.json.template` file from this repository in a text editor.
          *   Copy its contents and paste into the `config.json` file you just created.
          *   Replace `YOUR-GCP-PROJECT-ID` with your actual GCP Project ID.
          *   Replace `YOUR-GOOGLE-SHEET-ID` with the ID of your control spreadsheet (you can find this in the spreadsheet URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR-GOOGLE-SHEET-ID/edit`).
          *   Save the file.

      7.  Return to your control spreadsheet and refresh the page. The **Permissions Manager** menu will appear once the script is saved.

      </details>

      **Common issues at this step:**
      - ❌ `ReferenceError: "some_function" is not defined.` → This usually means the copy-paste was incomplete or the `node create_apps_scripts_bundle.js` script failed. Ensure the entire contents of `dist/apps_scripts_bundle.gs` are in the editor.
      - ❌ `Permissions Manager` menu does not appear → Refresh the spreadsheet. Make sure you saved the project in the Apps Script editor. Double check for any error messages at the top of the editor.
      - ❌ Timezone issues or dates appear incorrect → Verify you set the correct timezone in Project Settings (step 5).
      - ❌ `config.json` not found errors → Ensure you created the `config.json` file in the Apps Script editor with your GCP Project ID and Sheet ID (step 6).
