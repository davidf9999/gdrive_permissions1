      ## 1. Acquire a domain and start a Google Workspace tenant

      1. Purchase or select a domain you control (e.g., from Google Domains or another registrar).
      2. Start a Google Workspace trial at [workspace.google.com](https://workspace.google.com/).
      3. Use the domain from step 1 during sign-up.
      4. Create the initial Super Admin account and save the credentials securely.

      > **Why this matters:** Google Workspace is required for Admin SDK access and Google Groups management.

      ## 2. Verify your domain and access the Admin console

      1. In the Admin console, follow the domain verification prompts.
      2. Add the provided TXT record at your DNS host.
      3. Wait for DNS to propagate, then click **Verify** in the Admin console.
      4. Sign in at [admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com/) with your Super Admin account.
      5. Confirm 2-Step Verification (2SV) is enabled or complete the enrollment when prompted.

      > **Tip:** If verification fails, wait a few minutes and retry. DNS changes can take time to propagate.

      # Set the active project for future commands
      gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
