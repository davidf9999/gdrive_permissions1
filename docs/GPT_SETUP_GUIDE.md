# Custom GPT setup guide (no backend)

This guide explains how to configure a Custom GPT to assist with the `gdrive_permissions1` setup flow without running any backend services.

## Goals
- Provide consistent setup guidance.
- Avoid backend infrastructure.
- Keep the GPT prompt stable while allowing setup steps to evolve.

## Files to use
- **Prompt file (stable):** `GPT_PROMPT.md`
- **Knowledge file (regenerated):** `GPT_KNOWLEDGE.md`

> `GPT_KNOWLEDGE.md` is generated by `npm run build:docs`. It is deterministic and based on `docs/common/steps.yaml` plus the template in `GPT_KNOWLEDGE.template.md`.

## Configure the Custom GPT
1. Open ChatGPT and create a new Custom GPT.
2. Set the **System Instructions** to the content of `GPT_PROMPT.md`.
3. Upload **GPT_KNOWLEDGE.md** in the Knowledge section.
4. Enable browsing if you want the GPT to read additional files from GitHub.
   - If browsing is disabled, provide any extra files manually.
5. Save the GPT.

## Updating the knowledge
Whenever setup steps or docs change:
1. Run `npm run build:docs`.
2. Re-upload the regenerated `GPT_KNOWLEDGE.md` to the Custom GPT.

## Notes
- The prompt is intended to stay stable. Prefer updating the knowledge file instead of changing the prompt.
- If you enable browsing, the GPT can read public GitHub URLs, but you should still treat `GPT_KNOWLEDGE.md` as the source of truth.
