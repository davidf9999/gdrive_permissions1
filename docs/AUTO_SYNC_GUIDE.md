# Auto-Sync Guide

## Overview

The Auto-Sync feature allows the Permission Manager to run automatically on a schedule, eliminating the need for users to manually trigger syncs. This is particularly useful for:

- **NGOs with volunteers** - Volunteers can edit sheets without needing to run scripts
- **Teams with non-technical users** - No need to understand or trigger syncs
- **24/7 operations** - Changes are automatically applied within the scheduled interval
- **Avoiding OAuth complexity** - The script runs with the owner's permissions only

---

## How It Works

### The Problem It Solves

**Without Auto-Sync:**
1. Volunteer edits sheet (adds user email)
2. Volunteer must click "Permissions Manager ‚Üí Full Sync"
3. Volunteer may need to authenticate with Google
4. May encounter permission errors if not a Workspace user

**With Auto-Sync:**
1. Volunteer edits sheet (adds user email)
2. **That's it!** The change is automatically applied within 1 hour (or your chosen interval)
3. No authentication required from volunteer
4. Script runs with the owner's (your) permissions

---

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Enable Auto-Sync

1. Open your Permission Manager spreadsheet
2. Go to **Permissions Manager ‚Üí Auto-Sync ‚Üí ‚ö° Setup Auto-Sync (Hourly)**
3. Click "OK" when prompted

That's it! The script will now run automatically every hour.

### Step 2: Verify It's Running

To confirm auto-sync is active:

1. Go to **Permissions Manager ‚Üí Auto-Sync ‚Üí üìä View Trigger Status**
2. You should see: "Auto-sync is ENABLED"

## Configuration Options

### Choose Your Sync Frequency

**Hourly Sync (Recommended)**
- Menu: `Auto-Sync ‚Üí ‚ö° Setup Auto-Sync (Hourly)`
- Runs every 60 minutes
- Good for: Active NGOs with frequent changes

**Daily Sync**
- Menu: `Auto-Sync ‚Üí üìÖ Setup Daily Sync`
- Runs once per day at a specific hour
- Good for: Low-activity organizations

**Custom Interval**
- Menu: `Auto-Sync ‚Üí ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Custom Interval`
- Choose: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 12 hours
- Good for: Specific needs

### Enable/Disable in Config Sheet

You can temporarily disable auto-sync without removing the trigger:

1. Open the **Config** sheet
2. Find the row: `EnableAutoSync`
3. Change the value:
   - `TRUE` - Auto-sync will run on schedule
   - `FALSE` - Auto-sync will skip (but trigger remains installed)

This is useful if you want to pause automatic syncing temporarily (e.g., during maintenance).

## For NGO Administrators

### Setting Up for Your Volunteers

1. **You (the admin) set up auto-sync ONCE:**
   - Install the script (see main README)
   - Run `Setup Auto-Sync (Hourly)` from the menu
   - This creates a time-based trigger

2. **Volunteers can now:**
   - ‚úÖ Edit any sheet (add/remove emails)
   - ‚úÖ Add rows to ManagedFolders
   - ‚úÖ Work with regular Gmail accounts (no Workspace needed)
   - ‚ùå Don't need to run any menu items
   - ‚ùå Don't need to authenticate

3. **How volunteers see changes:**
   - Changes appear within 1 hour (or your chosen interval)
   - Check the `Last Synced` column to see when it ran
   - Check the `Status` column for any errors

### Manual Sync (For Immediate Changes)

If you (the admin) need immediate sync:

1. Go to **Auto-Sync ‚Üí ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Manual Sync Now**
2. Confirm when prompted
3. Changes apply immediately

Note: This requires YOU to be logged in (not volunteers).

## Advanced Configuration

### Customizing What Gets Synced

By default, auto-sync runs `fullSync()` (adds and deletes). To change this:

1. Open the Apps Script editor: **Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script**
2. Find the file `Triggers.gs`
3. Locate the `autoSync()` function (around line 68)
4. Change the sync type:

```javascript
// Option 1: Full sync (current default)
fullSync();

// Option 2: Only additions (never removes access)
syncAdds();
```

**When to use adds-only:**
- Your volunteers are less experienced
- You want to manually review deletions
- You prefer a more cautious approach

### Handling Errors

If auto-sync encounters an error:

1. **Email notifications** (if enabled in Config sheet):
   - You'll receive an email with the error
   - Configure: `EnableEmailNotifications = TRUE`
   - Set: `NotificationEmailAddress = your@email.com`

2. **Check the Log sheet:**
   - All auto-sync runs are logged
   - Look for entries starting with "*** Starting scheduled auto-sync..."

3. **Manual intervention:**
   - Run **Run Manual Sync Now** to see the error in real-time
   - Fix the issue in the sheet
   - Next scheduled run will retry

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Auto-sync skipped: another sync is already in progress"

**Cause:** A previous sync is still running when the next one starts.

**Solution:**
- This is normal for very large syncs
- The lock ensures only one sync runs at a time
- Next scheduled run will work fine

### "Auto-sync is disabled in Config sheet"

**Cause:** The `EnableAutoSync` setting in Config is `FALSE`.

**Solution:**
- Open the Config sheet
- Change `EnableAutoSync` to `TRUE`
- Next scheduled run will execute

### Triggers aren't running

**Check:**

1. **Verify trigger exists:**
   - Menu: `Auto-Sync ‚Üí View Trigger Status`
   - Should show "Auto-sync is ENABLED"

2. **Check trigger in Apps Script:**
   - Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script
   - Click the clock icon (‚è∞ Triggers) in the left sidebar
   - Should see: `autoSync` function listed

3. **Check execution log:**
   - Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script
   - Click "Executions" in the left sidebar
   - Recent runs of `autoSync` should appear

4. **Re-install trigger:**
   - Menu: `Auto-Sync ‚Üí Disable Auto-Sync`
   - Menu: `Auto-Sync ‚Üí Setup Auto-Sync (Hourly)`

## FAQ

### Do volunteers need Google Workspace accounts?

**No!** Volunteers can use free Gmail accounts. Only YOU (the script owner/admin) need a Workspace account.

### Can multiple admins use auto-sync?

The trigger runs with the **script owner's** permissions (whoever deployed it). Other admins can edit sheets, but the sync runs under one account.

### Does auto-sync use quotas?

Yes, but Google's quotas are generous:
- **Trigger quota:** 90 minutes of runtime per day
- **API quotas:** Admin SDK has daily limits

For most NGOs, hourly sync is well within limits. If you hit limits, switch to less frequent syncs (every 4-6 hours).

### Can I see when the next sync will run?

Unfortunately, Google Apps Script doesn't expose this via the UI. But:
- **Hourly triggers:** Run at the top of each hour
- **Daily triggers:** Run at your specified time
- Check the `Last Synced` column to estimate

### What happens if I'm in the middle of editing when sync runs?

No problem! The script:
1. Uses a lock to prevent concurrent runs
2. Reads sheet data at the moment it starts
3. Won't corrupt your edits

Your edits will be picked up in the next sync.

## Disabling Auto-Sync

To completely remove auto-sync:

1. Go to **Auto-Sync ‚Üí üõë Disable Auto-Sync**
2. Confirm when prompted
3. The trigger is removed

You can always re-enable it later using Setup Auto-Sync.

## Best Practices

### For NGOs with Volunteers:

1. ‚úÖ **Use hourly sync** - Volunteers see changes quickly
2. ‚úÖ **Enable email notifications** - You get alerts on errors
3. ‚úÖ **Train volunteers:**
   - "Edit the sheet, changes apply within an hour"
   - "Check Status column if unsure"
4. ‚úÖ **Run Dry Run Audit weekly** - Verify everything is correct

### For Production Use:

1. ‚úÖ **Start with adds-only** - Never accidentally remove access
2. ‚úÖ **Test with daily sync first** - Verify everything works
3. ‚úÖ **Monitor the Log sheet** - Check for patterns
4. ‚úÖ **Use Config sheet to pause** - Don't delete triggers during testing

## Technical Details

### Trigger Lifecycle

When you run "Setup Auto-Sync":

1. Script creates a time-based trigger via `ScriptApp.newTrigger()`
2. Trigger is stored in the project's trigger list
3. Google's servers call `autoSync()` on schedule
4. Function runs with **your** authentication context
5. Volunteers never interact with the trigger

### Security Model

- **Script runs as:** The project owner (you)
- **Permissions used:** Your Google Workspace admin permissions
- **Volunteers see:** Only the spreadsheet, no script access
- **OAuth:** Only you need to authorize the script

This is why volunteers don't need Workspace accounts!
