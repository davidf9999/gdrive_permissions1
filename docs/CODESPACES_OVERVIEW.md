# Codespaces overview (short)

GitHub Codespaces provides a hosted development environment for a repository. In this project, the Gemini CLI Assistant runs inside a Codespace by default unless you choose a local setup.

## Key points

* **Metered usage:** Codespaces is billed by compute and storage. The Usage page may show a gross amount while billed remains $0 if you are within included quota.
* **Quota resets:** Usage follows your billing month; see **Billing and licensing → Usage** for the current period and totals.
* **Manage or delete:** https://github.com/codespaces lets you stop a Codespace (halts compute) or delete it (halts storage and removes data).
* **Disable:** You can disable Codespaces in your personal settings: https://github.com/settings/codespaces (or org settings: `https://github.com/organizations/YOUR_ORG/settings/codespaces`).
* **Local option:** If you prefer not to use Codespaces, you can run the steps locally instead using the setup guide.
