# to run this setup. This account will be set as the active account for gcloud.

# The desired ID for your new Google Cloud Project.
# This does NOT need to be created in advance; the script will create it for you.
# IMPORTANT: GCP Project IDs must be globally unique. Choose something specific
# that is unlikely to be taken by another user (e.g., "my-company-drive-manager-123").
gcp_project_id="your-gcp-project-id"

# The ID of your Google Cloud Billing Account.
# This is REQUIRED. Google Cloud requires a project to be linked to a billing
# account to enable the necessary APIs, even if your usage falls within the free tier.
# You can find this ID in the Google Cloud Console under "Billing".
# See docs/ONBOARDING.md for more details.
billing_account_id="012345-ABCDEF-GHIJKL"

# This is required for the script to manage Google Groups via the Admin SDK.

# You can choose any name you like for your own reference.
